# Claude Code Workspace with Telegram Integration

This workspace provides a ready-to-use Claude Code setup with a Telegram bot bridge, enabling remote task execution and notifications from your phone.

## Skills & local instructions

This repo ships **only** the Telegram bridge — it is intentionally lean. Domain knowledge lives in your **installed skills** (`~/.claude/skills` plus built-ins): look up the relevant skill for the task instead of expecting it documented here. When the task daemon spawns a session, every user-level skill is available regardless of which folder the daemon runs from, so a generic launch still "knows" all your tooling.

**Private / local context:** if a `CLAUDE.local.md` file exists in this folder, read it first — it holds personal or internal instructions that are intentionally **not** committed (`CLAUDE.local.md` and `.claude/settings.local.json` are gitignored). Public users are free to drop their own custom instructions into `CLAUDE.local.md`; they will be picked up by Claude but never pushed to the public repo.

## Components

### MCP Server — `mcp/telegram-tg.js`
Zero-dependency Node.js MCP server (stdio, JSON-RPC 2.0) exposing two tools:
- **`tg_send`** — one-way notification (fire-and-forget)
- **`tg_ask`** — send a question and block until the user replies on Telegram

Both tools support optional `parse_mode` (`HTML`, `MarkdownV2`, `Markdown`) for rich formatting.

### Task Daemon — `mcp/telegram-task-daemon.js`
Always-on bridge that long-polls Telegram for messages and spawns `claude -p <task>` per message. Lets you send tasks to Claude Code from Telegram while you're away from your desk.

Features:
- Automatic session continuation (`--continue`) across messages
- Sentinel-based dedup (see rules below)
- Smart chunking for long outputs (respects Telegram's 4096-char limit)
- ANSI-strip for clean monospace output
- Cross-platform: auto-detects Windows vs macOS/Linux for process spawning

**Important:** `mcp/daemon-mcp.json` must include the `telegram-tg` server config so daemon-spawned Claude sessions can use `tg_send` for rich formatting. If it's empty (`{}`), the spawned sessions have no MCP tools and fall back to plain stdout — causing ugly monospace replies instead of rich HTML.

### Launcher — `mcp/start-task-daemon.ps1`
PowerShell 7+ script to start the daemon in foreground or background mode. Auto-kills any previous daemon instance on restart.

### Shortcut Installer — `mcp/install-shortcuts.ps1`
Creates Windows Start Menu + Desktop shortcuts for one-click daemon launch.

## Setup

1. **Create a Telegram bot**: Talk to [@BotFather](https://t.me/BotFather), get your bot token
2. **Get your chat ID**: Send a message to your bot, then visit `https://api.telegram.org/bot<TOKEN>/getUpdates` to find your `chat.id`
3. **Configure credentials** (pick one):
   - Copy `.mcp.json.example` to `.mcp.json` and fill in your token/chat_id
   - Or create `.telegram-config` in the repo root (see `mcp/.telegram-config.example`)
   - Or set env vars `TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN` and `TELEGRAM_CHAT_ID`
4. **Start Claude Code** in this workspace — the MCP server auto-starts via `.mcp.json`
5. **Optional — start the task daemon**:
   ```powershell
   .\mcp\start-task-daemon.ps1              # foreground
   .\mcp\start-task-daemon.ps1 -Background  # detached
   ```

## Shell Notes

- **Shell**: PowerShell 7+ (pwsh) is the default. Use the Bash tool when a POSIX command is genuinely needed.
- **Workspace profile**: If you have a `profile1.ps1` with custom functions, dot-source it:
  ```powershell
  . .\profile1.ps1; <your command>
  ```
  Every pwsh tool call runs in a fresh non-interactive session that does NOT load `$PROFILE`.

## Corporate TLS / Proxy

If your organization intercepts TLS (MITM proxy), Node.js will fail HTTPS calls because it bundles its own CA store. Fix: add `--use-system-ca` to the node args in `.mcp.json`:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "telegram-tg": {
      "command": "node",
      "args": ["--use-system-ca", "mcp/telegram-tg.js"],
      "env": { ... }
    }
  }
}
```

This requires Node.js 22+. PowerShell/curl already use the OS cert store and are unaffected.

## Telegram Behavioral Rules (CRITICAL — READ EVERY SESSION)

### IRON RULE: When running under the task daemon (`claude -p`), ALWAYS use `tg_send` to deliver your answer.

**Detection — am I running under the daemon?**
- Single task prompt (no conversation history) = daemon-spawned
- You have access to MCP tool `tg_send` via `telegram-tg`

**The rule — EVERY response goes through `tg_send`. No exceptions.**
- Use `tg_send` with `parse_mode: "HTML"` for ALL responses — short or long, simple or complex
- After calling `tg_send`, your stdout MUST be only: `[sent-via-tg]`
- NEVER output a substantive answer to stdout — the daemon wraps it in ugly `<pre>` monospace

**Formatting:**
- ALWAYS pass `parse_mode: "HTML"` to `tg_send`
- Use HTML tags: `<b>bold</b>`, `<i>italic</i>`, `<code>mono</code>`, `<pre>block</pre>`, `<a href="url">link</a>`
- Escape `<`, `>`, `&` in dynamic content as `&lt;`, `&gt;`, `&amp;`
- NEVER use Markdown syntax (`**bold**`, `` `code` ``) — Telegram renders them as literal characters

**Correct:**
```
Call tg_send with parse_mode:"HTML" → rich formatted message delivered
stdout = [sent-via-tg]
```

**WRONG (causes ugly monospace):**
```
stdout = Here is your answer with **bold** text...
(daemon wraps this in <pre> → user sees literal asterisks in a code block)
```

**Safety net (since 2026-05):** If you forget `tg_send`, the daemon now converts Markdown stdout to Telegram HTML before sending (bold, italic, code, bullets, headers, fenced blocks). It also auto-detects aligned CLI output and wraps it in `<pre>` to preserve column alignment. **This is a fallback, not a replacement** — you still get more control (custom layouts, links, escape correctness) by calling `tg_send` directly. The IRON RULE stands.

### When to use `tg_ask`
- Need user approval before a destructive action → `tg_ask`
- Need clarification or a choice → `tg_ask`
- After `tg_ask`, the sentinel `[sent-via-tg]` still applies

### When running interactively (not daemon), respond normally in chat. These rules only apply to daemon-spawned sessions.

### Safety

Always confirm destructive operations before executing. Use `tg_ask` to get remote approval when the user isn't at their desk.
